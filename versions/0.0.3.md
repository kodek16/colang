# Version 0.0.3: `if`, `bool`, blocks

## Features

- `var` and `read` statements now accept comma-separated lists, e.g.
  `var x: int, y: int`, `read x, y`.
- Notion of types is introduced. The two currently available types
  are `int` and `bool`.
- Added six comparision operators for `int`: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`,
  `==`, `!=`.
- Added block expressions and statements: if a block ends with an
  expression, then it's an expression, otherwise it's a statement.
- Added nested static scope system: every block introduces a new
  scope, shadowing is allowed.
- Added `if` expressions and statements. Expressions have a general
  form like `if (cond) x else y`, statements are not required to
  have an `else` branch, but their branches must be statement blocks.
